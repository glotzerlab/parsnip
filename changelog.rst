v0.4.0 - xxxx-xx-xx
-------------------

Added
~~~~~
- Support for Python 3.14
- Support for reading files via a context manager, text buffer, or string.
- Support for CIF2.0 ``"""`` and ``'''`` strings
- Support for COD-style ``_key \n 'value'`` strings
- Tests for a wider variety of edge case syntax features
- ``CifFile._wildcard_mapping`` lookup table for easier testing of wildcard keys.

Changed
~~~~~~~
- Regular expression parsing steps no longer need to backtrack, except in whitespace
  containing strings in loop tables
- Progressive and lazy Kleene star/plus operators are used where possible
- Key names now support the full range of characters specified in the CIF2.0 spec
- Regular expressions components now link to relevant portions of the CIF spec where
  possible

Fixed
~~~~~
- Data entries containing non-comment pound signs are no longer truncated
- Comments on ``loop_`` keyword lines no longer cause parse errors
- Unit cells for files without symmetry operations are now parsed correctly
- An infinite looping bug resulting from multiline strings with a particular structure


v0.3.1 - 2025-07-16
-------------------

Changed
~~~~~~~
- Source of ``LICENSE`` file in ``pyproject.toml`` to meet the change in Python spec.
- Test and Publish CI now fails on warning, allowing for easier debugging.

Removed
~~~~~~~
- Support for Python 3.8, which is incompatible with the changes to ``pyproject.toml``

v0.3.0 - 2025-07-16
-------------------

Added
~~~~~
- Additional testpath flag in conftest
- Symbolic parsing mode for ``build_unit_cell``

Changed
~~~~~~~
- ``build_unit_cell`` has a symbolic computation mode that allows for more accurate
  construction of unit cells.

Fixed
~~~~~
- Accessing data pairs with ``get_from_pairs`` or ``__getitem__`` now allows for case-insensitive searches
- Quote-delimited strings containing the delimiting character are now parsed properly
- ``build_unit_cell`` now rounds coordinates before wrapping into the box, fixing edge cases
  where boundary atoms were not properly deduplicated

v0.2.1 - 2025-03-12
-------------------

Added
~~~~~
- New ``additional_columns`` parameter for ``build_unit_cell`` that allows the return of
  atom site labels and similar data alongside unit cell positions.
- Ensured consistent ordering of lattice positions returned from ``build_unit_cell``.
- CI testing on Windows and macOS

Fixed
~~~~~
- Type hints now properly link to their associated documentation.

v0.2.0 - 2025-02-19
-------------------

Added
~~~~~
- Support for nonsimple (';'-delimited) data entries.
- Improved support for entries containing special characters.
- Ability to query multiple keys or columns simultaneously.
- Additional tests for AMCSD and zeolite databases.
- Additional documentation and examples for the new interface

Changed
~~~~~~~
- Primary interface is now the ``CifFile`` object, which supports all previously implemented features in addition to several new methods.
- Files are now parsed lazily, and are traversed a single time.

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Added ``more-itertools`` as a dependency for ``peekable`` iterators


v0.1.0 - 2024-12-20
-------------------

Added
~~~~~
- Unitcells module
- Function-based parsing interface for key and table reading
