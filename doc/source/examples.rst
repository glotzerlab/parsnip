This tutorial provides a complete introduction to **parsnip**, including its place in
the broader simulation and data science ecosystems. We begin by illustrating how
**parsnip** aids in simulation initialization in two common libraries, HOOMD-Blue and
LAMMPS. We then highlight **parsnip**'s class-leading performance reconstructing noisy
experimental data. We conclude with a tutorial on using **parsnip** to generate new
structures from existing data.
